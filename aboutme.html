            <h3 class="changetext">UX/UI designer</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I am a third-year Communication & Multimedia Design student at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, specializing in UX and UI design for various digital media.</p>

                <p>In addition to my focus on UX/UI design, I completed a minor in Information Design, which has broadened my understanding of how to effectively present complex data in a clear and engaging manner. I possess strong skills in wireframing, prototyping, graphic design, and basic coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technical skills enable me to bring my design concepts to life and ensure they are functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                <p>I am eager to further develop my skills in 3D and motion. I believe that incorporating 3D elements and animations can enhance user experience and create more immersive digital environments. I am currently exploring different tools and techniques in this area to expand my capabilities.</p>

                <p>Alongside my studies, I work as a barista at a popular coffee and sandwich shop in Amsterdam. This job has significantly enhanced my communication and problem-solving abilities in a fast-paced environment. Interacting with customers daily has improved my ability to understand and respond to their needs effectively. Moreover, managing multiple tasks simultaneously has taught me valuable time management skills.</p>
                    
                <p>I enjoy staying busy and continuously challenging myself. I'm also passionate about other creative fields, such as fashion, photography, and architecture. These interests allow me to draw inspiration from various sources and incorporate diverse elements into my design projects.</p>
