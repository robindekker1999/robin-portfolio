            <h2>Inclusive design used for gaming</h2>
            <div>
                <p>A lot of times designs are not inclusive. People with disabilities are often times left out. Therefore I started this project to help students with disabilities connect with others through gaming. The main focus lays on people with limited mobility. Therefore I started with doing research on how these people would also be able to play games. </p>
                
                <p>I soon stumbled upon then Xbox Adaptive controller. The Xbox Adaptive Controller is a video game controller designed by Microsoft to provide a customizable gaming experience for people with limited mobility. The controller can be customized through the Xbox Accessories app, allowing users to remap buttons and configure profiles. This flexibility is crucial for accommodating different physical limitations and preferences. </p>

            <h2>Inclusive design to help students connect</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The main challenge in this project is to help people with limited mobility connect with others. The University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam organizes events for people with disabilities called Limitless. But sometimes just going to these events isn't enough. People like to stay in touch and share their hobbies and passions whenever.</p>
                
                <p>So, in addition to the Limitless Gaming events, I created an online platform designed specifically for people with limited mobility. This way they can stay in touch with each other and be up to date on all future and past events from Limitess Gaming. </p>

            <h2>Design choices based on what people actually need</h2>
            <div>
                <p>While designing this platform, I kept in mind how a person with limited mobility would be able to use this aswell. This platform can be operated by using either the keyboard or a mouse. For mouse users, the buttons are extra large, to prevent miss-clicks and therefore errors. In addition to using the keyboard to chat, users can also use their voice to put speech to text. </p>
                
                <p>Combining the Limitless Gaming events and an online platform, people with or without limited mobility can still enjoy something they love and keep in touch with others.</p>
